<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the UT ACM's Programming Competition! Over the next few hours you will be solving a series of competitive programming questions using this website.
</p>

<p>
On the problems page you will find a list of the problems which you must solve. These problems are listed in no particular order and are all worth the same amount of points! There is not penalty for answering easier questions, and no bonus for answering harder questions. Your only goal should be to answer as many of these questions as possible.
</p>

<h2>Solving Problems:</h2>
<p>
For each problem, you will only receive a set amount of tries to correctly solve the problem. This number can found in the problem's description. Additionally, you will also only have a set amount of time to solve the problem, this amount of time can also be found in the problem's description. To solve a problem, click the “Attempt to solve” button for the problem which you wish to solve. Once you hit this button, one of your tries will be deducted and a timer will begin counting down from the time allotted to solve the problem. When it hits 0, you will then have to make another attempt at solving the problem. So do not hit the button until you are sure you are ready to solve the problem! After the hitting the button, you can then proceed to download the input file, runt it, and then upload your result and source (code) file to the website. You may then hit attempt to solve at which point you will be told if your solution is correct. If you have any questions about a problem, feel free to submit a clarification for it using the Submit Clarification form at the bottom of the problem's page. A judge will reply to you as soon as they have a chance.
</p>

<h2>The Scoreboard:</h2>
<p>
Finally, results can be viewed on the scoreboard page. Each contestant will have a row on the board, and they will be ranked by total scores, descending. Ranks are determined by total number of problems solved, with ties being broken by the amount of time taken to produce a correct solution. Under each problem, you will be able to see if someone has solved a problem, how many times they've attempted to solve a problem, and if they have solved it, how many minutes it took them to solve it.
</p>

<p>
A score with no correct solution and no attempts will appear as follows:

<p>
A score with no correct solution and some number of attempts will appear as follows, with the dash representing the lack of a solution, and the number representing the number of attempts:

</p>

<p>
And finally, a score with a correct solution will appear as follows, with the first number representing the minute at which the correct solutuion was received and the second represents the number of attempts it took to solve the problem:

If you have any further questions concerning the competition, feel free to come up and ask one of the judges.
