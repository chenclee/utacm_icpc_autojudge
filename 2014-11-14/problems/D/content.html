<h1 class="page-header">Palindromes</h1>

<p>You're given a string of characters. How many ways can you arrange these characters to make a palindrome?</p>

<p>A palindrome is a string of characters that can be read forwards and backwards the same. For example, 'racecar' and 'mom' are palindromes.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has an integer, N, the size of the string. The next line contains a single string (no whitespace) of size N.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>The size any string will not exceed 20.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print the number of ways that string could be arranged into a palindrome.</p>
