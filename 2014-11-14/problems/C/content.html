<h1 class="page-header">Blocks</h1>

<p>You love playing with numbered blocks. You have N blocks sorted in front of you, labeled 1, 2, ..., N. You can do two things with these blocks. If you have an untouched block, you may stack it onto your single tower. If you have blocks in your tower, then you may remove it and place it at the end of a new list.</p>

<p>You played the preceding game by going through the blocks in their sorted (increasing) order, until you touched and placed every block into a new list. When you were called to go eat dinner, your little brother moved around the blocks. You don't remember the order of your blocks after you finished, but you want to see if the new ordering of the list could've been created by playing the game.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has an integer, N. The next line has N integers, the ordering of the blocks after your brother rearranged them.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There will be no more than 1,000,000 blocks.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, if the end ordering is not possible, print NO on a single line. If it is possible, print YES on a single line, and then print the operations STACK and PLACE required to make that end ordering.</p>
