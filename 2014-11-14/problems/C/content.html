<h1 class="page-header">Blocks</h1>

<p>You and your little brother love playing with numbered blocks. You currently have N blocks lined up and sorted in front of you, labeled 1, 2, 3, ..., N. You and your brother have also come up with a game during which you can only do one of two things to the blocks:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Move the first block in the starting line and add it to the top of the tower</li>
    <li>Take the top block off of the tower and place it at the end of a new line of blocks</li>
</ol>

<p>One day while playing your little brother gives you a series of sequences to transform the standard sorted starting line into while only doing the two operations given above. He wants to see if you can come up with a sequence of moves to create each of the new block lines. He also says it is ok if  you can't find a way to generate the sequence.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has an integer, N. The next line has N integers, the ordering of the blocks after your brother rearranged them.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There will be no more than 1,000,000 blocks.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, if the end ordering is not possible, print NO on a single line. If it is possible, print YES on a single line, and then print the operations STACK and PLACE required to make that end ordering.</p>
