<h1 class="page-header">Probe</h1>

<p>Imagine you are the probe Philae, and are trying to land on the comet. You have two harpoons that you're going to use to attach to the comet. These harpoons are a distance of D meters apart, and both fire straight up. You want to find the best spot to land on. Given an array h that is the distance to the comet at each x value, you want to find the best spot to land. The best spot x is defined as the spot that, over the interval [x, x+D), that minimizes A(x) where A(x) = max(h[x], h[x+1], ..., h[x+D-1]) - min(h[x], h[x+1], ..., h[x+D-1]). To be a valid landing spot, the entire interval must be contained in the comet. If there are multiple "best" spots, choose the one where x is minimized.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the comet had a width of 5 meters, and the distances to the comet were represented as h = [5, 2, 7, 3, 9], and D = 3. Since D = 3, there are only 3 intervals to consider: [0, 2], [1, 3], and [2, 4]. A(0) = max(5, 2, 7) - min(5, 2, 7) = 7 - 2 = 5, A(1) = 5, and A(2) = 6. There are two answers, x=0 and x=1, that minimize the difference in terrain, so we want to choose the lower x value. Thus, the output will be x=0.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has two integers, W and D. W is the width of the comet in meters, and D is the separation of the harpoons in meters.
The next line contains W space-separated integers that correspond to the height at each meter of the comet.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There will be less than 10 test cases, W will not be greater than 1000, and D will be smaller than W.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print the index that is the best index to land at.</p>
