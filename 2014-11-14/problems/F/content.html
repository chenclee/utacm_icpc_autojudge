<h1 class="page-header">Binary Search Tree</h1>

<p>A binary tree is a tree who has at most two children. A binary search tree is a binary tree, where for some node, x, all of the values in x's left subtree are smaller than x's value and all of the values in x's right subtree are greater than x's value.</p>

<p>You're given a binary tree with integer values. In a single operation, you may change any node's value to be any real value. In at most K operations, can you turn this binary tree into a binary search tree?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has two integers, H and K. H represents the height of the tree, and K represents the maximum number of operations you can perform. The next line has 2^H - 1 integers. The root is at index 0. For each node, the left node is at index 2 * i + 1, and the right node is at index 2 * i + 2. There is only a node at any given index if the value at that index is positive. The input is guaranteed to be a single, connected binary tree.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>The height of any tree will not be greater than 10.<p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print NO, if it's not possible to turn the given binary tree into a binary search tree. If it's possible, then print YES.</p>
