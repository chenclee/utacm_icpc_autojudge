<h1 class="page-header">Thief</h1>

<p>You've broken into the museum, and slide down your rope... You're on quite a dangerous mission.</p>

<p>The museum is represented by an NxM grid, and the area is heavily guarded. There are some number of lasers pointing either North, East, South, or West at some various cells. In the room are several mirrors. If a laser hits the mirror, it is reflected to the North, East, South, or West depending upon how the mirror is angled. Anything outside the NxM grid is considered a wall, and lasers cannot burn through walls.</p>

<p>If you touch any laser, you immediately disintegrate. Luckily for you, the laser toggles on and off every second. You may also move North, East, South, or West in a single second. That means, you may move to a spot where a laser would shine, but you must move to another safe spot immediately afterwards. Otherwise... You die. You may not move on top of a laser or mirror. You must also stay within the grid.</p>

<p>And of course, there's a treasure located somewhere in the room. Can you make it to that treasure and back safely?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has two integers, N and M, the size of the museum grid. The following N lines has M characters in total. An 'N', 'E', 'S', 'W' represents a laser pointing either North, East, South, West respectively. The treasure is denoted with a '*'. Your starting position is denoted with a 'R'. There will always be a single '*' and 'R'. All walkable cells are denoted by a '.'. Now, we will talk about mirrors:</p>

<p>Mirrors may be the following: '/', '\', '|', '-'</p>

<ul>
	<li>'/' reflects a laser from the WEST to NORTH</li>
	<li>'/' reflects a laser from the NORTH to WEST</li>
	<li>'/' reflects a laser from the SOUTH to WEST</li>
	<li>'/' reflects a laser from the WEST to SOUTH</li>

	<li>'\' reflects a laser from the WEST to NORTH</li>
	<li>'\' reflects a laser from the NORTH to WEST</li>
	<li>'\' reflects a laser from the SOUTH to EAST</li>
	<li>'\' reflects a laser from the EAST to SOUTH</li>

	<li>'|' reflects a laser from the WEST to WEST</li>
	<li>'|' reflects a laser from the EAST to EAST</li>


	<li>'-' reflects a laser from the NORTH to NORTH</li>
	<li>'-' reflects a laser from the SOUTH to SOUTH</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>North = Up</li>
	<li>East = Right</li>
	<li>South = Down</li>
	<li>West = Left</li>
</ul>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There are at most 10 test cases. The size of the grid never exceeds 1,000,000 cells.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print YES if you can get the treasure and escape; otherwise print NO.</p>

<h4>Explanation of Sample I/O</h4>
<p>For test case 1, you have enough time to move pass the single column laser to get to the treasure. Then you can wait and do the same to get back.</p>

<p>For test case 2, you can't ever move past the two consecutive columns of lasers without being disintegrated.</p>

<p>For test case 3, this is the same as test case 2, but has mirrors instead</p>
