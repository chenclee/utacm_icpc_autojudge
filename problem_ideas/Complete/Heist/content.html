<h1 class="page-header">Heist</h1>

<p>You've finally determined your victim's schedule. And today is the ONE day, that you'll get your revenge. Your victim victimized you one day and kept a number of your belongings. You shall get them back.</p>

<p>You've laid out the blueprints of the house and have determined the location of every one of your belongings. You also have your victim's schedule, a slot of times in the day that your victim is out. Each time slot that your victim is out, you plan to invade the house and take back what's rightfully yours. Due to your overly precuatious nature, you only take a single item each time slot your victim is out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you may not have enough time to take back everything. You've determined, to the minute, how long it takes for you to steal back each item individually. You also recall the value of each item. What's the most amount of value you can steal back?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has two integers, N and K. N is the number of time slots your victim will be out. K is the number of items you want to get back. The following N lines have time slots, which will be represented with two integers A and B. The range [A, B] represents the minutes in that day that your victim is out from A to B. The following K lines have two integers, M and V. M is number of minutes it takes to steal back the item, and V is the value of that item.</p>

<p>No two time slots will ever overlap. As an example, these slots overlap:</p>

<ul>
	<li>[1, 5] and [4, 7]</li>
	<li>[1, 2] and [2, 3]</li>
</ul>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There are at most 10 test cases. N, the number of slots, will never exceed 60 * 24, the number of minutes in a day. K will never exceed 1000. A and B are both bounded by N. A must be smaller than B. M is bounded by N. V never exceeds 100,000.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print the maximum amount of value you can steal back from your victim.</p>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>
<pre>
2
1 2
1 1440
5 800
5 750
2 2
100 898
5 20
800 10000
750 1
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>
<pre>
800
1
</pre>

<h4>Explanation of Sample I/O</h4>
<p>For test case 1, your victim is out all day [1, 1440], but you can only take a single item per time slot, thus, you can take back a maximum of $800 worth.</p>

<p>For test case 2, your victim is out at [100, 898] and [5, 20]. [5, 20] is too short for you to steal either item, and [100, 898] is 1 minute too short to steal your item worth $10,000. So, you can only steal $1 back.</p>
