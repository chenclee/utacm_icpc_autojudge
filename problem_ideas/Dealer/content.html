<h1 class="page-header">Dealer</h1>

<p>I have to admit, you're a pretty good programmer, but you're pretty freakin' bad at cards.</p>

<p>The game you and your rivals play is a simple game. Some number of cards are dealt by a robot to everyone. Everyone gets the same amount of cards. Before the robot passes out the cards, someone shuffles the cards and gives them to the robot. Then, the robot makes sure no one cheated by ensuring all cards are there. Unfortunately, you don't know how to shuffle, but everyone else does. You haven't won a single game in your life, and have you have no idea why...</p>

<p>There are currently K people playing the game, including you. If there are N cards, then N must be divisible by K, and everyone gets N / K cards. The cards are also labeled 1, 2, ..., N. Someone wins if the sum of their cards is greater than everyone else's hand sum.</p>

<p>You're sick and tired of losing. You've lost millions to these crooks. You decide to hack the robot when everyone leaves. Luckily for you, the robot stores the location of every card right before it deals. You have to figure out how to use this to your advantage...</p>

<p>You somehow managed to get the robot to second hand deal. What does this mean? It means that the robot can deal the second card from the top instead of the first one. However, your hardware hack is buggy, so once it second hand deals, it has to normally pass out a single card before having the option of doing it again.</p>

<p>You don't want to play a round that you won't win. So, you've programmed the robot to message you when you'll lose. However, you still need to figure out if you can win or lose a round given the hacks you've made. Write that program.</p>

<p>The robot always deals to the left first, and you will always be the first to the left of the robot. The robot has the option to second hand deal on the first card.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has two integers, N and K. N is the number of cards, K is the number of people playing. The following line has N integers, the ordering of the N cards.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There are at most 10 test cases. Neither N or M will exceed 1,000. N and M will be positive.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print YES if you can win that round; otherwise print NO.</p>

<h4>Sample Input</h4>
<pre>
2
4 2
3 2 1 4
9 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
</pre>

<h4>Sample Output</h4>
<pre>
YES
NO
</pre>

<h4>Explanation of Sample I/O</h4>
<p>For test case 1, you can take the 3 and give your opponent the 2. Then the robot should second hand deal you the 4, and then give your opponent the 1. Thus, you have a hand sum of 7 and your opponent has one of 3.</p>

<p>No matter what second hand deals you do, you cannot win.</p>
