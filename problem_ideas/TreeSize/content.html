<p>Recursion is cool. Trees are cool. Trees are like recursion. How do trees grow? Maybe like this...</p>

<p>We say that an N-ary tree is a tree whose nodes have at most N children each. So, let's say that you're given N, the maximum number of nodes any node of a tree can have. Let's say that you're also given N probabilities, p{1}, p{2}, ..., p{N}. Let's say that p{i}, where is is from 1 to N, represents the probability that some node can generate a child in the ith position. When a node is generated, it may also generate more nodes itself with the same probabilities.</p>

<p>If you're given a seed node to begin with, what's the expected size of such a tree to be?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case has a single integer N, representing the maximum number of children each node can have. The following line of each test case consists of N probabilities in double percision.</p>

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>There are at most 10 test cases. The probabilities will be in the range [0, 1). No answer will exceed the size of a signed 32-bit integer.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, print the expected size of the tree rounded to 3 decimal points.</p>

<h4>Explanation of Sample I/O</h4>
<p>For test case 1, this is the same as solving determining the average number of consecutive heads you'll flip with a fair coin. Then, adding 1 to that answer</p>

<p>For test case 2, you can't ever create new nodes aside from the one you're given</p>
