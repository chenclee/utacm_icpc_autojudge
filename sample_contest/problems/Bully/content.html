<h1 class="page-header">Bully</h1>

<p>School is rough as it is. It's no better when you have a bully...</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Prime bully has chosen you to be his victim. Each day, before lunch, he will come up to you and take away a fraction of your money. He selects a random prime number, P, that divides the number of dollars you have, D, and then takes away D/P dollars for you.</p>

<p>On top of that burden, you still have to pay for lunch at a total cost of L dollars. Assuming the best case scenario, what's the maximum number of days you could pay for lunch?</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases you have<br/>
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers: D, the amount of dollars you have initially, and L, the cost of daily lunch in dollars.
