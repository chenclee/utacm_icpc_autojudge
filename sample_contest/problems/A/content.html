<h1 class="page-header">Air Traffic Control</h1>

<p>An airline has two flights leaving at about the same time from ICPCity, one to city B and one to city A.
The airline also has n counters where passengers check their baggage. At each counter there is a pair of
identical baggage bins, one for city B and one for city A.</p>

<p>Just before the flights depart, each pair of baggage bins is moved by a motorized cart to a sorting area.
The cart always moves two bins at a time, one for city B and one for city A. After all the bins have been
moved, they line up in the sorting area like this:</p>

<p>B A B A B A ... B A</p>

<p>That is, there are 2<i>n</i> baggage bins in a row, starting with a bin for city B, then one for city A, and so
forth. The task now is to reorder them so all the baggage bins for city A precede the baggage bins for
city B. Then the bins can be loaded on the appropriate aircraft.</p>
