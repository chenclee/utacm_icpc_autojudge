<h1 class="page-header">Buffed Buffet</h1>

<p>You are buying lunch at a buffet. A number of different dishes are available, and you can mix and
match them to your heart’s desire. Some of the dishes, such as dumplings and roasted potatoes, consist
of pieces of roughly equal size, and you can pick an integral number of such pieces (no splitting is
allowed). Refer to these as “discrete dishes.” Other dishes, such as tzatziki or mashed potatoes, are fluid
and you can pick an arbitrary real-valued amount of them. Refer to this second type as “continuous
dishes.”</p>

<p>Of course, you like some of the dishes more than others, but how much you like a dish also depends on
how much of it you have already eaten. For instance, even if you generally prefer dumplings to potatoes,
you might prefer a potato over a dumpling if you have already eaten ten dumplings. To model this, each
dish <var>i</var> has an initial tastiness <var>ti</var>
, and a rate of decay of the tastiness <var>∆ti</var>
. For discrete dishes, the tastiness
you experience when eating the <var>n</var>
th item of the dish is <var>ti − (n − 1)∆ti</var>
. For continuous dishes, the
tastiness you experience when eating an infinitesimal amount dx grams of the dish after already having
eaten <var>x</var> grams is <var>(ti − x∆ti)dx</var>. In other words, the respective total amounts of tastiness you experience
when eating <var>N</var> items of a discrete dish or <var>X</var> grams of a continuous dish are as follows:</p>
